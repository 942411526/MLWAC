## Overview

This is the **official implementation** of MLWAC: a modular and low-coupling network for visual navigation in unstructured environments.

MLWAC introduces a **Waypoint-Angular Coordinated (WAC)** control strategy that fuses geometric waypoint cues and model-predicted angular velocities, enabling robust and adaptive navigation across diverse unstructured scenarios.
